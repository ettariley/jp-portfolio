# Job Prep Portfolio Site

This is the first draft of my portfolio site for the Job Prep Course for Career Foundry. Actual portfolio site will be created as a later assignment for the Full Stack Web Development Course. This was set up with Create React App and is deployed via GitHub Pages.

See the demo site [here](https://ettariley.github.io/jp-portfolio).
