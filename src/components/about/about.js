            <p className='mt-3'>I’ve spent a decade learning about and helping people, and in my pursuit to problem-solve for clients, organizations, and communities, I kept coming back to one thing: all the ways technology and access to it can improve lives. I felt like I needed to be a part of this growing group of creative problem-solvers using these flexible tools to build incredible solutions, so I decided to change course and pursue a career in web development.</p>
            <p>I’m open to remote or local (Northeast Tennessee/Southwest Virginia) work in full-time or freelance roles. While I’ve enjoyed developing websites/web apps in React the most, you can check out my portfolio to further explore the other technical skills I’ve developed.</p>
            <p>When I’m not working, you’ll find me outside, on a walk, listening to an audiobook. It’s the best way to de-stress! I also enjoy going out on the local lakes and rivers. If I’m inside, I’m probably still listening to an audiobook, but I’m cuddling my dogs, baking, or sewing. Sometimes, you can even find me on stage in a community theatre show.</p>
